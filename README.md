## About the Project

This project is a fictitious website that I developed to enhance my skills in front-end development. The goal was to create a creative and engaging website that serves as a showcase for imaginary web design services. The site is designed to give visitors an idea of the various services that could be offered by a real agency specializing in web design and digital marketing.

## Technologies

The following technologies were used in the development of this project:

- **HTML5**: The basic structure of the website.
- **CSS3 & Bootstrap 5**: For responsive layout and styling.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactive elements.

A notable feature is the use of Bootstrap 5, one of the leading frontend libraries, which offers a wide range of predefined CSS classes that facilitate the development of responsive layouts.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures optimal display on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Modern UI/UX**: A fresh and modern design that enhances user experience.
- **Pure Frontend Implementation**: Demonstrates the ability to create interactive websites using frontend technologies.

## Usage

Since this project uses exclusively frontend technologies, it can be launched directly by opening the `index.html` file in a browser. No additional installation steps are necessary.
