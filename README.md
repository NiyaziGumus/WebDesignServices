## About the Project

This project is a fictitious website that I developed to enhance my skills in front-end development. It has been converted to PHP and adapted into a WordPress theme to facilitate its use as a fully functional WordPress template.

## Technologies

This project now incorporates the following technologies:

- **HTML5 & PHP**: The basic structure of the website.
- **CSS3 & Bootstrap 5**: For responsive layout and styling.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactive elements.
- **WordPress**: As the CMS backend to manage content easily.

A notable feature is the use of Bootstrap 5, one of the leading frontend libraries, which offers a wide range of predefined CSS classes that facilitate the development of responsive layouts.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures optimal display on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Modern UI/UX**: A fresh and modern design that enhances user experience.
- **WordPress Theme**: The site is structured as a WordPress theme to allow easy content management and updates.
